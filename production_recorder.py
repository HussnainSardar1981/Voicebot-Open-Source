"""
Production-Grade Audio Recorder using TALK_DETECT and MixMonitor
Professional implementation following Asterisk best practices for barge-in and recording

PROFESSIONAL-GRADE IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
===========================================

1. TALK_DETECT Barge-in: Uses TALK_DETECT(200) for fast, accurate voice detection
   during TTS playback. Stops playback within 200-300ms of caller speech.

2. Clean Recording Windows: MixMonitor only runs during silent windows after
   playback stops, eliminating self-transcription and "thank you" hallucinations.

3. Trailing Silence Detection: Implements professional VAD state machine with:
   - Speech start detection (300+ bytes)
   - Guard window protection (800ms)
   - Trailing silence detection (6 consecutive 100ms no-growth checks)
   - Hard cap protection (50KB max)

4. Proper File Handling: StopMixMonitor + 0.4s settle time + size verification
   with 0.25s retry for small files, ensuring complete file availability.

5. Conversation Flow: Post-reply listen window (3-4s) prevents premature
   call endings when caller starts speaking late.

6. Standards Compliance: Ready for enterprise MRCP/SpeechBackground integration
   while maintaining Whisper ASR compatibility.

USAGE:
- detect_barge_in_with_talk_detect(): For TTS with barge-in
- get_user_input_with_mixmonitor(): For clean speech capture
- conversation_flow_with_post_reply_window(): For complete conversation turns
